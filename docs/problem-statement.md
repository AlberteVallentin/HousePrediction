# Problem Formulation

## Project Title

**Intelligent House Price Prediction System - A Machine Learning Approach to Real Estate Valuation**

## Problem Statement

In real estate markets, pricing a home accurately is one of the most critical — and often most subjective — parts of the transaction process. Buyers, sellers, and agents alike frequently rely on intuition or generic market trends rather than the unique characteristics of each property and its surroundings. This project addresses that challenge by building a Business Intelligence solution that uncovers patterns in historical housing data to explain how factors like location, condition, size, and amenities influence sale prices. By analyzing structured housing data from Ames, Iowa, we aim to increase transparency in the pricing process and support data-driven decision-making for all market participants.

## Relevance

This challenge is important because housing is one of the largest financial decisions most people make, yet the pricing process often lacks transparency. By integrating data analytics and machine learning, this project proposes a practical and evidence-based approach to improve fairness and accuracy in property valuation.

## Research Questions

**Primary Research Question:**

- How can machine learning techniques be applied to predict residential property prices, and what level of accuracy can be achieved using property characteristics as predictive features?

**Secondary Research Questions:**

- Which property characteristics have the greatest influence on house price prediction, and how can we quantify their relative importance in the valuation process?
- How do different categories of machine learning algorithms compare in terms of prediction accuracy and model reliability for real estate valuation?
- To what extent can automated machine learning models provide practical value for real estate stakeholders compared to traditional property valuation methods?

## Hypotheses

**H1**
Physical property characteristics related to size and quality will emerge as the strongest predictors of house prices, reflecting fundamental real estate valuation principles where larger, higher-quality properties command premium prices.

**H2**
Advanced machine learning algorithms will outperform traditional linear models in real estate price prediction due to the complex, non-linear relationships between multiple property characteristics and market values.

**H3**
Combining multiple machine learning approaches will achieve superior prediction accuracy compared to relying on any single modeling technique, as different algorithms may capture different aspects of the price-prediction relationship.
